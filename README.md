The Heritage Mapper Android Application provides an opportunity for Canadians to discover more about our country by highlighting the location of historical sites designated by the Federal Park's Department. It allows users the ability to select locations they've already visited and those they wish to visit, so as to keep track of their federal historical site experiences.
