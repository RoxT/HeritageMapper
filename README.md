Coded for the Canadian Open Data Experience 2014, Feb 28-March 2!

The Heritage Mapper Android Application provides an opportunity for Canadians to discover more about our country by highlighting the location of historical sites designated by the Federal Park's Department. It allows users the ability to select locations they've already visited and those they wish to visit, so as to keep track of their federal historical sight-seeing experiences.

Data
==============
The Heritage Mapper is powered by Park's Department Federal Heritage Destinations, National Historic Site's dataset (http://data.gc.ca/data/en/dataset/b8c61621-e541-4e4c-8654-48152519a30a)

Overview
==============

HeritageMapper parses all historical locations in the dataset as Point Of Interest objects. The MainActivity class consists of an interface with Google Maps which places a Marker at all of the locations of the historical POIs in Canadian. Users are able to search for locations, and indicate locations as being on their wishlist or as having been there. Marker colours are adjusted according to these three categories.

Features
==============
1. French and English translations of location information
2. Differentially coloured Markers for three separate categories: default, places users have visited, and places users want to visit
3. Persistent wish list and visited list

Packages
==============
1. au.com.bytecode.opencsv / contains open source csv parser
2. ca.jchoi.HerritageMapper / contains main application classes

Future Expansions
==============

Potential future features include:
1. The ability to reach the location information pages from the info window popups on the map interface
2. The ability to filter sites by proximity to user
3. Routing between sites (finding the optimal path between sites the user is interested in)
4. Social connectivity, such as the ability to tag oneself at locations and view other user's tags, as well as leave comments at locations
